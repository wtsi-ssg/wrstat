var RootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "wrstat",
	Short: "wrstat gets stats on all files in a filesystem directory tree.",
	Long: `wrstat gets stats on all files in a filesystem directory tree.

It uses wr to queue getting the stats for subsets of the tree, so enabling the
work to be done in parallel and potentially distributed over many nodes.

Before doing anything else, the wr manager must be running. If the manager can
run commands on multiple nodes, be sure to set wr's ManagerHost config option to
the host you started the manager on. Or run commands from the same node that you
started the manager on.

If you need root to have permission to see all deseired files, either start wr
manager as root, or start it as a user that can sudo without a password when
running wrstat, and supply the --sudo option to wrstat sub commands.

For raw stats on a directory and all its sub contents:
$ wrstat walk -o [/output/location] -d [dependency_group] [/location/of/interest]

Combine all the above output files:
$ wrstat combine [/output/location]

Or more easily work on multiple locations of interest at once by doing the
above 2 steps on each location and moving the final results to a final location:
$ wrstat multi -w [/working/directory] -f [/final/output/dir] [/a /b /c]`,
