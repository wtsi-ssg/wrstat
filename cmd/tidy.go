	Long: `Tidy up multi output.

This is called by 'wrstat multi' after the main work has completed. It moves
final output files from the supplied unique working directory to the
--final_output directory, then deletes the working direcory.

multi creates a unique ("multi unique") directory, in which it creates
directories named after the basename of the directory of interest
("interest basename"), in which it creates another unique directory ("interest
unique"), in which it creates the output files.

tidy assumes the working directory you give it is the "multi unique" from multi.
It probably won't do the right thing if not.

Final output files are named to include the given --date as follows:
[date]_[interest basename].[interest unique].[multi unique].[suffix]

Where [suffix] is one of 'stats.gz', 'byusergroup.gz', 'bygroup' or 'logs.gz'.

The basedirs.* files directly inside the given "multi unique" directory is
named:
[date]_[multi unique].basedirs.*

It also moves the combine.dgut.db directories to inside a directory named:
[date]_[multi unique].dgut.dbs
(making them sequentially numbered sub-directories)

Finally, it creates or touches a file named '.dgut.dbs.updated' in the
--final_output directory, giving it an mtime matching the oldest mtime of the
walk log files. 'wrstat server' will use this file to reload its database and
update its knowledge of when the data was captured.

The output files will be given the same user:group ownership and
user,group,other read & write permissions as the --final_output directory.

Once all output files have been moved, the "multi unique" directory is deleted.

It is safe to call this multiple times if it was, for example, killed half way
through; it won't clobber final outputs already moved.`,
