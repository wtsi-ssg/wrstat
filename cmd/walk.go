wr manager must have been started before running this. If the manager can run
commands on multiple nodes, be sure to set wr's ManagerHost config option to
the host you started the manager on. Or run this from the same node that you
started the manager on.

For full access to all files, either start wr manager as root, or start it as a
user that can sudo without a password when running wrstat, and supply the --sudo
option to this command.

For each entry recursively within the directory of interest, their paths are
written to output files in the given output directory. The number of files is
such that they will each contain about --inodes_per_stat entries.

For each output file, a 'wrstat stat' job is then added to wr's queue with the
given dependency group. For the meaning of the --ch option which is passed
through to stat, see 'wrstat stat -h'.

(When jobs are added to wr's queue to get the work done, they are given a
--rep_grp of wrstat-stat-[id], so you can use
'wr status -i wrstat-stat -z -o s' to get information on how long everything or
particular subsets of jobs took.)

NB: when this exits, that does not mean all stats have necessarily been
retrieved. You should wait until all jobs in the given dependency group have
completed (eg. by adding your own job that depends on that group, such as a
'wrstat combine' call).`,
